                        <p>"I flew in from Toronto for two nights, bringing my camera and gimbal to try new things on-site. The workshop was excellent with professional equipment and a big team of organizers who always helped and explained things. The organization was great—I visited a film studio and got tons of useful information that I started using as soon as I got back. It was a great chance to meet new people and share experiences. A few months after the workshop, I was in a stressful situation at an important event shoot, and the skills I learned, especially the Gimbal moves, helped me succeed. I can't imagine where else I could have tried such a variety of professional equipment. This was the best workshop I've attended."</p>

The workshop was a great experience because it allowed me to operate the professional film camera (hand held Steadicam and gimbals) which gives me the ultimate respect to the camera department for their skill levels."</p>

                        <p>"I signed up for the SteadyCam workshop with the music video component. Cliff was a blast to work with. He's a good teacher - fun, funny, patient. I feel like I gained a lot of confidence with a SteadyCam and even learned some tricks on how to make a DIY one. His assistants were super helpful and I could tell that they genuinely admired Cliff (One of his AC's was dropping industry secrets about how to not get fired from set which I thought was pretty cool) I would recommend this to anyone who wants to level up their Cam Op or AC skills as the class not only gives you hands on experience with cinema cameras but also significant time practicing your focus pulling skills. Turned out to be a wonderful networking opportunity too as one of the attendees was a Sound Mixer that I now work with frequently in Seattle."</p>
